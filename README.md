# Mortgage_Calculator

Group Project for Object Oriented Programming with Applications Course
A C# program that simulates a mortgage calculator. The calculator has the following features:
• A filter to start the process, check if the customer can
apply for a mortgage credit (age)
• It asks for the annual income of the customer
• The credit does not exceed 30% of the income
• The credit will be rejected if the customer has an annual income of less
than £15,000.
• There are only two types of properties: House and Flat.
• The interest rate is fixed
• The printed outcome says if the credit was rejected or accepted. In case
it was accepted, it tells the total credit amount offered and the interest
rate of the credit.
